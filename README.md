3 display a chart : this chart represent the best comapnies which have the most clients
4 authentication : each users must to be autheticated with username and password and just then they will see all flights
5 offline support - persist data on the local storage : database which contain planes with (id plane ,company name,ticke price,destination for plane
6 online support - synchronize date to/from a remote location : keep data from database into my application
